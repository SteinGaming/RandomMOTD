# Random MOTD
*A random project I made out of boredom.*

Reddit post because of which I did it: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/12km11c/randomise_motd/).

This mod goes cycles through a list of motds.
You can add them in ``config/randommotd.json`` (where you're also able to change the delay).

Most of the project files were stolen from my [PayAll](https://github.com/SteinGaming/PayAll) project lol.

## Building

1. Clone this repository or download it
2. In the Terminal, ``./gradlew shadowJar`` OR Windows ``./gradlew.bat shadowJar``
3. You can find the mod file in ``output/``

That's it! :D
